Today we began to actually program with Python and the Warm-Up Exercise became a full-class 
exercise. There were two exercises. With the first one, we were given with 5 3D shapes composed
of equal-sized cubes. We used Jupyter Notebook to create a program that calculates the surface 
area and volume of each shape. For the other exercise, we created a program that calculates the
quadratic function. The program asks the user for the variables a, b, and c, and the program
prints out the results. Finally, we submitted our codes up to GitHub.
