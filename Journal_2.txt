We elaborated upon what we learned last class and gained an even clearer understanding on the
different GIT commands. We started off the class with a warm up exercise that helps us understand
the purpose and usage of various GIT commands. Then, later on, we reviewed the materials from
the previous class, and Dr. Pinzon showed us more examples of how the commands can be used.
