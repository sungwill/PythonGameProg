This is the first class of Python, and we first started with a practice about VCS (Version
Control System) to gain a general understanding of it. Then, we practiced using GIT with an
online tutorial in which Mr. Pinzon guided us through it later on. We also installed the GIT
system and began practicing with functions like adding to stage areas and the commit function.
