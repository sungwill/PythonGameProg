This is the first class of Python, and we first started with a practice about VCS (Version
Control System) to gain a general understanding of it. Then, we practiced using GIT with an
online tutorial in which Mr. Pinzon guided us through it later on. We also installed the GIT
system and began practicing with functions like adding to stage areas and the commit function.

We elaborated upon what we learned last class and gained an even clearer understanding on the
different GIT commands. We started off the class with a warm up exercise that helps us understand
the purpose and usage of various GIT commands. Then, later on, we reviewed the materials from
the previous class, and Dr. Pinzon showed us more examples of how the commands can be used.

We started programming with Python today. Three available python systems are available for us: 
python, ipython, and jupyter notebook. We watched a few videos to learn how to print "Hello World,"
then we learned how to implement math equations in it and did an exercise on converting temperature 
units. Later, we learned the two variables for python: int and float, and the differences between 
the two. Finally, we finsihed the class by researching some python functions that are assinged to us,
and we share our results on a class google document.

Today we began to actually program with Python and the Warm-Up Exercise became a full-class 
exercise. There were two exercises. With the first one, we were given with 5 3D shapes composed
of equal-sized cubes. We used Jupyter Notebook to create a program that calculates the surface 
area and volume of each shape. For the other exercise, we created a program that calculates the
quadratic function. The program asks the user for the variables a, b, and c, and the program
prints out the results. Finally, we submitted our codes up to GitHub.

We began with a warm-up exercise in which we learned the concepts and usages of boolean, if
statements, and imports. We used pycharm for the first time, and learned how to pass arguments
on command line with "import sys" and "sys.argv." Dr. Pinzon also taught us the difference in
the logic behind "and" and "or". Every condition between each "and" must be true in order for
the entire condition to be true. On the other hand, for "or," only one condition is required for
the entire condition to be true.

We worked on our warm up practice, which contains exercises for using the while loop. We began
by first drawing out a flow diagram for the exercise to get a neat understanding of how the while
loop should run. We tried to figure out the algorithm for the first exercise, which is a program 
that extracts digit from a number. If the user inputs 4867, then the program should print out 
each digit one by one:

Digit #1 = 4
Digit #2 = 8
Digit #3 = 6
Digit #4 = 7
