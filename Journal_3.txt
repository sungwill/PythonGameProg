We started programming with Python today. Three available python systems are available for us: 
python, ipython, and jupyter notebook. We watched a few videos to learn how to print "Hello World,"
then we learned how to implement math equations in it and did an exercise on converting temperature units.
Later, we learned the two variables for python: int and float, and the differences between the two.
Finally, we finsihed the class by researching some python functions that are assinged to us, and
we share our results on a class google document.
